# common features
+ base [express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express).
+ write by [TypeScript](https://www.npmjs.com/package/typescript).
+ divide global config and module config.
+ modularization development, use `user module` as example.

```
+---modules
|   \---user
|           user.config.ts
|           user.controller.ts
|           user.dto.error.ts

|           user.types.ts
|   \---other module
```

+ MongoDB(use [mongoose](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongoose)).
+ global service, like [`base.orm.service.ts`](./src/service/base.orm.service.ts) and [`redis.service.ts`](./src/service/redis.service.ts), you can import these common services to your module.
+ global unified response results, whatever normal response or error response. please look [unify-response.ts](./src/helper/unify-response.ts) file.
+ 404 and error handler.
+ logs([morgan](https://www.npmjs.com/package/morgan) and [debug](https://www.npmjs.com/package/debug) to terminal, [winston](https://www.npmjs.com/package/winston) to files).

+ [nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon) dev and [pm2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pm2) deploy.

# Q&A

+ why do it?

I want to make a standardized template for future Node development. I can use this template directly when I need to start a Node project.

+ why dont use like `new HttpException(401, 'no authentication');` response error info?

I know a lot of people do, but I don't like this form, because I think every time `new` class object, it will request new memory, I think this is not necessary, based on js features, the most convenient method to call function directly.

Using a custom method to process http result will make it easy and fast, and we can ensure that the interface of the HTTP request response is consistent. It'll be friendlier to client development people.

+ why not suppose MySQL?

I'll add MySQL in the feature.

+ why not suppose server render? like ejs nunjucks and hbs?

If I had time I'd do a new branch to support server-side rendering nunjucks.

+ will suppose Vue or react or Angular server render?

Maybe, I'm not sure, because the focus of this project is server end, not front end.

# todo
+ Use Winston to standardize the log information and write api to process the log information, write log info to database.
+ Performance monitoring and warning measures, use email notice project members.
+ API interface documentation for the project
+ File upload management, rather than simply upload files
+ ...
